  "summary": "The diff implements the core requirements for dual pricing, fare estimator, T&C checkbox, and UI refresh on the Car Rentals page. REQ-38, REQ-39, REQ-40, and REQ-41 are substantially covered. Backend migration and schema updates are present. Minor gaps exist around explicit no-box-shadow enforcement and full confirmation of footer T&C link.",

    {
      "requirement": "The T&C page must remain accessible from the footer (REQ-40 AC: 'The T&C page remains accessible from the footer')",
      "reason": "The diff summary for Footer.tsx only mentions TanStack Router Links for internal navigation generally, but does not explicitly confirm a Terms & Conditions link is present in the footer.",
