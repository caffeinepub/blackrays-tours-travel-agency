  "summary": "The diff implements most of the requested requirements, including address fixes, homepage redesign, car emoji removal, airports data file, flight/hotel booking upgrades, and premium UI styling. However, several specific acceptance criteria are not fully evidenced in the diff, particularly around CarRentalsPage.tsx changes (REQ-58, REQ-59), comprehensive coverage of all pages in the premium UI refresh (REQ-63), and some REQ-55 address fixes in specific files like TermsPage.tsx and AboutPage.tsx.",

      "requirement": "Move 'Most Popular' badge to the Sedan vehicle card, remove it from SUV, place Sedan first with prominent border/accent treatment in CarRentalsPage.tsx",
      "reason": "No changes to CarRentalsPage.tsx are present in the diff. The file is not listed as a modified file, so there is no evidence of Sedan/SUV badge changes.",
