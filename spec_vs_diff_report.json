  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of requirements: new backend inquiry model extensions (REQ-18, REQ-24), new pages for Custom Packages, Railway Bookings, Flight Bookings, and Terms & Conditions (REQ-17, REQ-21, REQ-22, REQ-23), updated Car Rentals page with per-km pricing (REQ-19), hero image replacement (REQ-20), updated homepage services section (REQ-25), updated header and footer navigation. However, several specific acceptance criteria have gaps, particularly around the admin inquiries page displaying the new fields for all new inquiry categories.",
