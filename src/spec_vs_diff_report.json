  "summary": "Diff adds a deployment slug constant/documentation plus SPA hosting fallback files (_redirects, 404.html). However, there is no concrete evidence in the diff of an actual platform deployment/publish configuration or that the chosen slug is wired into the hosting/deployment system; publish/live reachability and route accessibility cannot be verified from the provided changes.",

      "requirement": "Select and configure a valid deployment domain/slug that includes \"blackrays\" and satisfies platform domain rules, and ensure the invalid prior domain is not used.",
      "reason": "A valid-looking slug is introduced in code/docs, but the diff summary does not show it being applied to any real deployment/hosting configuration (i.e., no evidence the platform will actually use this slug for the live domain).",

Added SPA fallback files help hosting, but they do not demonstrate that a live deployment exists or that routes are reachable at a configured live URL.",
