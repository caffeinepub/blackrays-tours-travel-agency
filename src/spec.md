# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Choose a valid deployment domain/slug containing “blackrays” and publish the website so it is live.

**Planned changes:**
- Select and configure a valid platform domain/slug that includes “blackrays” and uses only letters, numbers, and hyphens (5–50 characters), avoiding the previously invalid domain.
- Deploy/publish the existing site to the configured live URL and verify main routes load (/about, /packages, /car-rentals, /contact).

**User-visible outcome:** The website is live and reachable at a valid “blackrays”-containing URL, with the home page and primary navigation routes accessible.
