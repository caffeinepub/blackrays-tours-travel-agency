The platform should feature a consumer-friendly, error-free premium interface with direct flight and railway ticket booking via third-party APIs, alongside existing tour packages, custom travel packages, and car rentals.",

    "Flight and railway ticket booking must use live third-party APIs (e.g., Amadeus for flights, IRCTC/RailConnect for railways) to enable direct consumer bookings — not just inquiry capture.",
    "Hotel booking requires integration with a real-time hotel API (e.g., Booking.com, Hotels.com, Amadeus Hotel API, or similar) covering India and international properties."

    "Live flight/railway API integration requires valid API credentials and potential regulatory/partnership approvals (e.g., IRCTC agent registration); may not be immediately available.",
